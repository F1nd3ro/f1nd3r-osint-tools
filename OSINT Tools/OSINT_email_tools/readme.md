### Email OSINT tools
Tools that I commonly use to investigate emails during an active OSINT investigation (missing person or recon).
Always start wih running the email address trough basin search engines (Google and Bing are the least you can do)
If you get few results remove the domain of the emial address or use doulbe quotes aorund the whole emial.

## GHunt:
GHunt reuires some installation and configuration, it is a modulable OSINT tool designed to evolve over the years, and incorporates many techniques to investigate Google accounts, or objects.
It currently has email and document modules.

## Epios Email Tool
Apios has two tools in their website, at the moment of the last commit the phone tool was not wokring but their emial tools is pretty useful when you have a gmail account.

You get the following information trought a web interface:
Email : Target's email
Name : Target's name associated to the account 
GoogleID : The Google ID if a Google account is linked to that email 
Last Update : Lats time the target accessed the account 
Maps: Only if they have made comments or check ins
Photos: Only if they have linked picture to theri account
Calendar : Only if they have open calendars

## ThatsThem
ThatsThem is free and allows you to find information associated to an email address, you need to be aware of the context fo your target and verufy if the informaiton returned is in fact useful. 
If your target is a missing teenacer and you get somebody with the same name that is 65 yrs old you are looking at a false positive.

## Dehashed
Dehashed is a pretty nefty service, it allows you to check if the email of interest is part of a data breach and sometimes cna lead to get a password of your target. Just be aware that to be able to see the password yo will have to pay for a subscription (you can get a 7 dyas subscription for less than 7 dollars).

## HaveIBeenPwned
HaveIBeenPwned is similar to DeHashed it will list the websites that the email has been pwned, this eill allow you to have a good idea of what websites the target frequents and may also help you to build their profile.
